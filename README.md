# Text-Analysis-Project

1. Project Overview 

I used the Gutenberg Projects "Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley". I manipulated the data in order to extract the top words used in the book in order to find out what words may have made Frankenstein such a novel book in its time and the precedent for so many horror movies to follow it. Considering how genre defining it is (aswell as being one of my favorite books) I felt that it was an interesting subject for analysis.
